/**
 * @struct code_aliases_t
 *
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief Stores pointers to memory that is allocated for executable
 *     code that is compiled into the kernel, that must be mapped into the
 *     microkernel's root page tables. Some operating systems will not
 *     provide the physical address of a page that is mapped into the
 *     executable portion of a kernel module (e.g., Linux). To overcome this
 *     the executable code is copied into an alias page. When the function
 *     is executed using the kernel module's page tables, nothing changes, but
 *     when the code is executed from the microkernel's page tables, the
 *     pages stored here provide the page that stores the executable code
 *     instead, ensuring we have a means to get a physical address of a page
 *     that has the code we want.
