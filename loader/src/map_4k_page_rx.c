/**
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief This function maps a 4k page given a physical address into a
 *     provided root page table at the provided virtual address. If the page
 *     is already mapped, this function will fail. Also note that this memory
 *     might need to allocate memory to expand the size of the page table
 *     tree. If this function fails, it will NOT attempt to cleanup memory
 *     that it allocated. Instead, you should free the provided root page
 *     table as a whole on error, or once it is no longer needed. Finally,
 *     this function will map using read/execute access permissions.
 *
 * <!-- inputs/outputs -->
 *   @param virt the virtual address to map phys to
 *   @param phys the physical address to map
 *   @param rpt the root page table to place the resulting map
 *   @return 0 on success, LOADER_FAILURE on failure.
